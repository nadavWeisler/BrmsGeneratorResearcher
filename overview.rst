RMS Overview
=============

Repeated masking suppression (RMS) is a technique for presenting stimuli below the
threshold of consciousness for long durations. RMS is closely related to Continuous
Flash Suppression (CFS; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), but relies on different visual principles
that enable its use without any apparatus additional to a computer screen and a modern
computer. It is based on forward- and backward-masking, separating the target stimuli and
mask in time. In RMS participants are presented with masks interleaved with a target
stimulus appearing at a lower contrast level. The masking stimulus is presented for
a duration of 67 ms each time, while the target is presented for a duration of
only 34 ms (See figure below).

In breaking RMS (bRMS) - the paradigm enabled by this software package - stimuli are
presented long enough for the target stimulus to break through RMS and become visible.
Participants' task is to indicate the location of the target stimulus relative to midscreen
as soon as it becomes visible. Participants' reaction times thus serve as a measure of
the time they needed to become conscious of the target stimulus - or its breaking time (BT).
bRMS BTs have been demonstrated to be a valid measure of prioritization for consciousness,
and show convergent validity with bCFS BTs (Abir & Hassin, 2020).
